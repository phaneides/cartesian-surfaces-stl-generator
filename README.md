# Cartesian Ovoid stl generator. 

Command based utilitie for generate high quality `.stl` files for the 
Cartesian Surfaces. 

There are two ways for specify the form of the curve, that is 
by G, O, T, S parameters and by physical parameters (n0, z0, ni, zi). 

The code is maily focused in generate singlets formed by Cartesian Surfes, 
that is the surface that one obtains when two Ovoids intersects.
